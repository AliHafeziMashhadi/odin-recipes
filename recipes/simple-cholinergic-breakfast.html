    <h1>Why Choline to Start The Day?</h1>
    <p>You ask the right questions.</p>
    <p>I try to make sure I don't convince myself of things that aren't true.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, I've noticed in my personal experience, having eggs and heated whole wheat toast in the mornings gives me optimal focus.</p>
    <h2>Foods High In Choline:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg - 164mg per serving</li>
        <li>Shittake Mushrooms - 116mg per serving</li>
        <li>Beef - 115mg per serving</li>
        <li>Pistachio's - 88mg per serving</li>
        <li>Cauliflower - 44mg per serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll be honest.</p>
    <p>That's just not a list of foods high in choline, it's also our ingredients list.</p>
    <p>Just substitute cauliflower for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/365-Everyday-Value-Cauliflower-Riced/dp/B07Q77T4RG/ref=sr_1_5_f3_0o_wf?crid=1WBC2Q58HPVLZ&keywords=cauliflower+rice&qid=1670807923&sprefix=cauliflower+rice%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-5">Steam-Fried Style Cauliflower Rice</a>.</p>
